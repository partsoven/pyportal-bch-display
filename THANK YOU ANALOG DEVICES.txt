This ADABOX could not have happened with out the amazing support 
and sponsorship from Analog Devices (https://www.analog.com/)

Analog Devices is famous for their high quality sensors. In fact, the first
temperature sensor we ever used here at Adafruit was the TMP36 - an analog
temperature sensor in a 3-pin package. It was first released in 1996, and
since then ADI has only improved on their designs to create more precise
temperature sensors!

The PyPortal features the ADT7410, the latest precision temperature
sensor from the experts at sensing at Analog Devices! The ADT7410 lets
your PyPortal become a self-contained Internet of Things temperature
data logger that can sense and record the world around it and then either
display it on the lovely screen, or upload it to adafruit.io for long
term storage and analysis.
